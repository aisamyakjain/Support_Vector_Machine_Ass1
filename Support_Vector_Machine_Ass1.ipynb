    "\n",
    "Answer: Sure! Let's start with a two-dimensional example to visualize these concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hyperplane: In SVM, the hyperplane is the decision boundary that separates the data points of different classes. For a linear SVM, the hyperplane is a line. In the example below, the red line represents the hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "         +        +\n",
    "          \\      /\n",

    "            \\  /\n",

    "          /    \\\n",
    "         /      \\\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Marginal Plane: The marginal plane refers to the planes parallel to the hyperplane that touch the support vectors. These planes are equidistant from the hyperplane and define the margin. In the example, the dashed lines represent the marginal planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "        --------->   Marginal Plane\n",

    "        |      |\n",
    "        --------->   Marginal Plane\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Soft Margin: Soft margin allows for some misclassification by allowing data points to fall within the margin or even on the wrong side of the hyperplane. It uses a slack variable to tolerate misclassified points. In the example below, the circles represent misclassified points within the margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "         +        +\n",

    "          /    \\\n",
    "         /      \\\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hard Margin: Hard margin SVM aims for perfect separation and does not allow any misclassification. It requires the data points to be linearly separable without any points within the margin or on the wrong side of the hyperplane. In the example, there are no misclassified points within the margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "         +        +\n",
    "                   Marginal Plane\n",
